# django-amiqus


Django app for integration with the Amiqus API.

The current version supports Django 3.2+ and Python 3.10+.

## Background

Amiqus is an online identity verification service. We use this library
to integrate with it.

## Amiqus workflow

There are three core entities that are modelled in this app: `Client`,
`Records`, and `Check` (pending deprecation, and soon to be renamed
`Step`). At a high level they fit together thus:

1. A `Client` represents someone against whom you wish to carry out an
identity or background check. They are unique within Amiqus, although
it's possible to carry out multiple checks over a period of time against
one user.
1. A `Record` is a suite of checks that will have an overall status that
combines the statuses of all the constituent checks.
1. A `Check` / `Step` is an individual check - it could be an identity
   check, a facial recognition check, etc. See the API for all details.
