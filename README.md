Django app for integration with the Amiqus API.

The current version supports Django 3.2+ and Python 3.10+.

## Background

Amiqus is an online identity verification service. We use this library
to integrate with it.

## Amiqus workflow

Core entities included in this app are `Client`, `Record`, `Step`, `Check`,
`Form`, and `Review`

### `Client`
Represents a person against whom you wish to carry out an
identity or background check. They are unique within Amiqus, although
it is possible to carry out multiple checks over a period of time against
one user.

### `Record`
A collection of `Steps` that a `Client` is required to complete.
The `Client` receives a link where they are presented with the various `Steps`.

### `Step`
Can be either a `Check` or a `Form`. The Amiqus platform
does support `Document` type `Steps`, but these are not currently supported by
this package.

### `Check`
May each be of the types described in `Check.CheckType`. This
includes things like photo ID verification and watchlist monitoring.

### `Form`
Defined in the Amiqus platform and consists of one or more questions
that the `Client` must answer.

### `Review`
Each `Step` may be reviewed in the Amiqus interface. This creates a `Review`
object that can be queried via the API .

## Installation
